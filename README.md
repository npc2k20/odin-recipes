# odin-recipes
This exercise is a culmination of what I've learned so far in the Odin Project.
I'll be creating a simple recipes page using HTML. I'll be practicing a couple of Git concepts as well.

Admittedly, I still need a lot of practice using Git. 
The Git workflow still doesn't come naturally to me right now but, with a bit 
more repitition, I'll hopefully get it down.
